Introduction <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n\nIn this lab, you will get a chance to use the IBM API Connect (APIC) Designer and its intuitive interface to import and edit an API using the OpenAPI definition (YAML) of an existing Customer Database RESTful web service.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will explore the following key capabilities:\n\n-   Creating an API by importing an OpenAPI definition for an existing REST service\n\n-   Configuring ClientID/Secret Security, endpoints, and proxy to invoke an endpoint\n\n-   Testing a REST API in the developer toolkit\n\n-   Publish an API for developers\n\n# 2. Deploying the REST Services <a name=\"deploy\"></a>\n\nFirst, you will deploy a Customer Database REST service and then you will download the OpenAPI file for the Customer Database REST service that you deployed.\n\n1\\. In a browser, enter the URL for the Platform Navigator that is provided by your instructor.\n\nBefore beginning this lab, you will want to make sure that you have completed the [API Connect Experience Prereq instructions](../APIC-prereq/index.md).\n\n2\\. When you log in for the first time, you may see a **Welcome, let's get started** window.  Feel free to review the contents by click **Start the tour** or by click on the **X** to close the window.\n\n![alt text][pic91]\n\n3\\. Navigate to the **App Connect Dashboard**.\n\n![alt text][pic92]\n\n4\\. Click on the **Dashboard** icon in the left navigation.\n\n![alt text][pic93]\n\n5\\. For this lab, we already have the REST service built and available as a **bar** file. You can download the **CustomerDatabaseV1.bar** file for the service [here](./resources/CustomerDatabaseV1.bar).\n\n6\\. Click on **Deploy integrations**.\n\n![alt text][pic94]\n\n7\\. Click **Quick start integration** and click **Next**.\n\n![alt text][pic95]\n\n8\\. Drag and drop the BAR file that you just downloaded or click to upload.  Once you have dragged and dropped or uploaded, you will see the bar file listed under **to be imported**.  Click **Next**.\n\n![alt text][pic96]\n\n9\\. Click **Next**.\n\n![alt text][pic97]\n\n10\\. Give the Integration Server a **Name** (e.g., username-customerdb) and click **Create**.\n\n![alt text][pic98]\n\n11\\. This will take you back to the Runtimes Dashboard where you will see your new server. It will likely be showing Pending while it is starting up the pod.\n\n![alt text][pic99]\n\n12\\. Note: It may take a several minutes to start up. You can refresh the page. Once it is up and running it will show the following:\n\n![alt text][pic100]\n\n13\\.  Click on the newly created Runtime.\n\n![alt text][pic101]\n\n14\\. Click on the **CustomerDatabaseV1** API.\n\n![alt text][pic102]\n\n15\\. Confirm that the **Overview** tab is selected and click **Download OpenAPI Document**.\n\n![alt text][pic103]\n\n[pic0]: images/0.png\n[pic1]: images/1.png\n[pic2]: images/2.png\n[pic3]: images/3.png\n[pic4]: images/4.png\n[pic5]: images/5.png\n[pic91]: images/91.png\n[pic92]: images/92.png\n[pic93]: images/93.png\n[pic94]: images/94.png\n[pic95]: images/95.png\n[pic96]: images/96.png\n[pic97]: images/97.png\n[pic98]: images/98.png\n[pic99]: images/99.png\n[pic100]: images/100.png\n[pic101]: images/101.png\n[pic102]: images/102.png\n[pic103]: images/103.png\n\n# 3. Import an API into the Developer Workspace <a name=\"import_api\"></a>\n\n1\\. Click on **IBM Cloud Pak** in the upper left.\n\n![alt text][pic104]\n\n2\\. Navigate to the API Connect instance.\n\n![alt text][pic6]\n\n3\\. If this is your first time logging in, the login page is presented. Click **Common Services User Registry**.\n![alt text][pic8]\n\n4\\. Confirm that you are in the provider organization for your username (upper right) and then click on **Develop APIs and products**.\n\n![alt text][pic9]\n\n5\\. We are now able to begin to create APIs and Products.  Click **Add**.\n\n![alt text][pic10]\n\n6\\. Click **API (from REST, GraphQL or SOAP)**.\n\n![alt text][pic11]\n\n7\\. Click **Existing OpenAPI** under **Import** and click **Next**.\n\n![alt text][pic12]\n\n8\\.  Drag and drop the yaml file that you just downloaded or click to upload.  Once you have dragged and dropped or uploaded, you will see the yaml file listed under and should see a notification that the \"YAML has been successfully validated\".  Click **Next**.\n\n![alt text][pic13]\n\n9\\. Make sure that the **Activate API** <span style=\"color: red\">is not</span> selected and click **Next**. \n\n![alt text][pic14]\n\n10\\.  The API should be imported successfully as shown in the image below.  Click **Edit API**.\n\n![alt text][pic15]\n    \n[pic6]: images/6.png\n[pic7]: images/7.png\n[pic8]: images/8.png\n[pic9]: images/9.png\n[pic10]: images/10.png\n[pic11]: images/11.png\n[pic12]: images/12.png\n[pic13]: images/13.png\n[pic14]: images/14.png\n[pic15]: images/15.png\n[pic104]: images/104.png\n\n# 4. Configure the API <a name=\"configure_api\"></a>\n\nAfter importing the existing API, the first step is to configure basic security before exposing it to other developers. By creating a client key and secret security, we are able to identify the application using the API. \n\nNext, we will define the backend endpoints where the API is actually running. IBM API Connect supports pointing to multiple backend endpoints to match your multiple build stage environments. \n\nFinally, we will configure the proxy call to invoke the endpoint.\n\n## 4a. Configure API Key Security <a name=\"configure_security\"></a>\n\n1\\. Schemes define which transfer protocols you want your API to use. Make sure that the **Design** tab is selected and click on the **+** next to **Schemes List**.\n\n![alt text][pic18]\n\n5\\. From the **Select an option** drop-down menu, select **https**.

Publish API <a name=\"publish_api\"></a>\n\nIn this lab, you will make the API available to developers. In order to do so, the API must be first put into a product and then published to the Sandbox catalog. A product dictates rate limits and API throttling.\n\nWhen the product is published, the Invoke policy defined in the previous lab is written to the gateway. \n\n## 5a. Create Customer Product and Add API <a name=\"customer_product\"></a>\n\n1\\. From the vertical navigation menu on the left, click **Develop**.\n\n![alt text][pic80]\n\n2\\.

Configure the API <a name=\"configure_api\"></a>\n\nAfter importing the existing API, the first step is to configure basic security before exposing it to other developers. By creating a client key and secret security, we are able to identify the application using the API. \n\nNext, we will define the backend endpoints where the API is actually running. IBM API Connect supports pointing to multiple backend endpoints to match your multiple build stage environments. \n\nFinally, we will configure the proxy call to invoke the endpoint.\n\n## 4a.
